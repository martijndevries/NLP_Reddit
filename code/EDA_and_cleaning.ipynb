    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A US political consultancy company is researching how news sources and discussed topics differ between the US political mainstream and the conservative right-wing media. In the last decade or so, the US political right-wing has been increasingly described as living in an entirely separate information ecosystem from the political mainstream. In order to gauge how intense this effect is, we will collect, process, and classify the Reddit content of two politically-themed subreddit that reflect the mainstream and conservative voters respectively: <b>r/politics</b> and <b>r/conservative</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will build two separate branches of models: one for post submissions (largely consisting of links to news sites), and another for comments (consisting of actual Reddit users discussing political news). As this is a binary classification problem where the two classes are of equal interest and will be approximately balanced, we will use the accuracy score as the main metric to gauge the success of the classification model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because political news is always evolving, we have chosen a specific moment in time: the month leading up to the 2022 midterms, October 6th to November 6th 2022. This ensures that 1) the same news cycle is covered for both subreddits, 2) both subreddits were at peak activity, and 3) maximum potential for interesting insights in the way that news is discussed within these two subreddits."
